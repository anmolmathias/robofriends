App built with React and Tachyons to experiment with dynamic searching, responsive layouts and material design. Uses [JSONPlaceholder's](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) REST API to get fake user data which is then paired with [ROBOHASH](https://robohash.org/) to generate unique image placeholders for each user/card. Check it out [here.](https://anmolmathias.github.io/robofriends)
